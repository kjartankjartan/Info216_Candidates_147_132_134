To run our code you must download the zip file named Final_216Project. Here you will find the model we have developed in Jena.
models.ttl is the file with the finished code. Open the .idea in Jena, import the Apache Jena library, and the json-simple-1.1 library
Run the code and everything should print in the console. In the repository you can also find the cleaned data set we used, our ontology,
